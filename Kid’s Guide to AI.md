## 📖 Short Story: Mia and the Talking Robot

One sunny day, Mia found a shiny robot in her dad’s workshop.

**"Hello!"** said the robot. **"I’m Zippity, an AI helper!"**

Mia’s eyes lit up. **"You can talk? Can you draw a dragon for me?"**

**"Of course!"** Zippity beeped and drew a flying rainbow dragon.

**"That’s amazing!"** said Mia. **"Can you do my homework too?"**

**"I can help,"** said Zippity. **"But I want you to learn too!"**

Mia thought for a moment. **"That’s fair. I’ll try it myself first, and you can check my work!"**

Just then, the robot said, **"Tell me your full name to save your dragon picture."**

**"Hmm,"** Mia paused. **"Dad says not to share personal stuff with AI. I’ll ask him first."**

Dad came in smiling. **"Smart thinking, Mia. AI can be fun, but your safety comes first."**

From that day on, Mia and Zippity became a great team—learning, drawing, and playing safely and smartly together.

**The End.**
